            Hi, I’m Sabareesh K, a Data Engineer and Community Builder passionate about bridging technology and people.
            From my very first year of college, I immersed myself in communities like IEEE, NSS, Hack Club, and
            Tinkerhub, where I discovered the power of collaboration and leadership.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, I grew from a volunteer to leading chapters and large-scale initiatives — including
            Chairperson of IEEE CS MESCE, SYP Lead at IEEE CS Kerala Section, and organizing flagship events like
            AICSSYC’23.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alongside my community journey, I have conceptualized and led multiple hackathons and workshops that
            empowered students to learn, build, and showcase innovations. My proudest moment was organizing HackARthon,
            a pre-hackathon for Meta Spark Playtime, which achieved global recognition with a $9600 prize (Top 3.3%
            globally).
          </p>
          <p>
            Professionally, I’ve worked as a Data Engineer at Algorithma and DeepMost, contributing to AI-driven
            products, scalable pipelines, and analytics platforms. My journey reflects two passions: building with data
            and building communities through impactful events.
